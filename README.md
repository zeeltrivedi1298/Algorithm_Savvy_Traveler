Brief Description on how to run the code:

1)There is three .py files and three respective inputs for the files.      

2)In the given code user must change vertices and probability as per the graph.

3)There is three programs with different inputs for given graph with their probability as below:

Input 1: ed = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 5], [2, 5], [3, 5], [3, 6], [4, 5], [4, 7], [5, 6], [5, 7], [6, 7]]
prob = [0.8, 0.7, 0.9, 0.8, 0.6, 0.6, 0.9, 0.6, 0.8, 0.8, 0.6, 0.7, 0.7, 0.9]

Input 2: ed= [[0,1], [1,2], [2,5],[5,4],[4,1], [4,3],[3,0],[3,6],[6,7],[7,4]]
probs= [0.8, 0.6 ,0.8, 0.9, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.8, 0.9,0.6]

Input 3:  ed= [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,0],[0,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7],[7,4],[7,3],[6,2],[5,1]]
probs= [0.8,0.6,0.9,0.9,0.8,0.6,0.9,0.6,0.8,0.7,0.6,0.7]

4)After giving required inputs user should run the code.
